# SPEC0+

The Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination (SPEC) mechanism is used to recommend
project policies, coding conventions, and standard tooling.

This project extends [SPEC 0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/) to
consider other support windows.
The neuroimaging community in particular is slower moving than much of the scientific
Python community, and so SPEC0+1yr is a relatively common convention for core libraries.

See https://scientific-python.org/specs/ for a list of SPECs and their statuses.
